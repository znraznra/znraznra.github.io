					<h1 class="title has-text-danger">Welcome to my personal blog.</h1>
					<p>This was supposed to be an animation portfolio website, but things didn't go as planned. Since I already bought my own domain for cheap, I thought it would be a waste to just let this rot the way it is and decided to just build a blog out of sunk-cost fallacy.</p>

					<p>I used to love animation and art but it never loved me back, so I did what any adult would do--give up and stop chasing after ghost trails and dreams that are not only impractical but unrewarding to do. Doing these won't get me out of the red, nor gain back the lost 8 years of my life grinding and chasing after a break and a career that almost cost me my marriage. It's about time for me to grow up and start doing what I'm supposed to do: earn money to pay debts, buy a permanent home, and save up enough money for a cremation plan.</p>
					
					<p>This blog will just be all about me trying to do something different, or me complaining about life and my personal demons that I never win against. Do not expect anything positive from this either.</p><br/>
